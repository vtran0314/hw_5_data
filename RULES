Capture the Flag
==================

Using whatever tools you can find, find a way to utilize the program's code to
print the flags on your serial terminal.

You can use whatever tools you find on the internet to help you with analyzing
the binary. You may need to exploit bugs in the software to complete this
assignment. Your answers must include the methods you utilized to reverse
engineer the binary, your testing methodology, and the series of inputs that
you provide to the program to trigger the desire effects.

Grading scale:
- First flag:	75 points
- Second flag:	25 points
- Third flag:	10 points


Files
=======
binary.elf: Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file with code for the
            MSP430G2553 microcontroller.
binary.hdr:	ELF headers for the file. Shows the sections of the file and the
            places they occupy on the memory layout of the microcontroller.
binary.dsm: Disassembled binary. Shows the disassembled binary. Note that you
            will not be able to utilize this listing to reassemble the binary.
binary.hex: Intel HEX file containing the binary. Some programs will be able to
            parse this file and use it to programm your microcontroller.
